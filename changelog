Change log
==========

v0.7.5 November 2019
--------------------

 * Adding better sanitization of geometry in presence of NaN

-----------------

 * Fix round cap on degenerate cubic bezier (with null normal)
 
v0.7.4.2 December 2018
----------------------

V0.7
----

 * Addition: Gradient Mesh!

v0.6.1.1 May 2016
-----------------

 * Fix: GHC 8.0 bound fix

v0.6.1 May 2015
---------------

 * Fix: Correcting bytestring lower bounds

v0.6 May 2015
-------------

 * Adding: repeating background pattern texture.
 * Added: PDF output without images (for now)

v0.5.2.1 April 2015
-------------------

 * Fixed: non-composability of cached elements
 * Fixed: Border size when drawing images was twice too large.

v0.5.2 April 2015
-----------------

 * Enhancement: Added a withGroupOpacity to render elements with
   a global opacity.

v0.5.1 March 2015
-----------------

 * Enhancement: Generalizing geometry description, with automatic
   conversion, reducing the need of type constructor from Primitive,
   and directly filling Path.

v0.5.0.3 February 2015
----------------------

 * Fix: hackage documentation

v0.5.0.2 February 2015
----------------------
 * Removing test-suite as it's dependent of some repository-local files

v0.5.0.1 February 2015
----------------------
 * Fix: adding missing Arbitrary file in the distribution.

v0.5 February 2015
------------------

 * Breaking Change: Font size is now a newtype in FontyFruity,
   propagating the changes.
 * Allowing to specify DPI at the top level of the rendering
   request.
 * Adding: an helper function to retrieve the distance to the
 * Changed: font size switched to float.

v0.4.2 February 2015
--------------------
 * Fix: Cubic bezier clipping

v0.4.1 January 2015
-------------------
 * Fix: GHC 7.10 compilation
 * Adding: Various lens to access some primitive informations.

v0.4 December 2014
------------------

 * Breaking change: Changed the original position scheme for
   text, allowing to specify baseline or upper left corner

 * Tried: Fast forward differencing for cubic bezier, not worth
   the hassle
 * Enhancement: Further optimized decomposition of all primitives,
   less alocated memory.
 * Enhancement: After optimizing pixel writing, optimized pixel
   reading, yielding non-negligeable speed improvements.
 * Added: an "immediate" module to avoid constructing
   a scene tree.
 * Enhancement: Allowing both IO & (ST s) as drawing monads, enabling
   interleaved drawing with io operations.
 * Added: a "withPathOrientation" function to orient primitives
   on a path (allow to draw curved text)
 * Added: toNewXBase transformation to create a new basis given
   a X axis vector.
 * Added: a PathWalker module, to give access to the lower level
   path orientation facility.
 * Added: some GHC rules for transformations
 * Added: a new text function: 'printTextRanges' to allow
   easier complex text rendering

v0.3 June 2014
--------------

 * Enhancement: Switching main free monad type to the church encoded one.
 * Enhancement: Optimized the bezier decomposition, strictness annotations
   made wonders. May require forward differencing in the future.
 * Enhancement: Implementing specific decomposition for lines.
 * Enhancement: Reworked texture system, now allowing some specialized
   filler (hoping faster computation). For now only the
   solid color has been optimized, and all the transformed
   textures.
 * Enhancement: Fixing space leak in combineEdgeSamples, avoiding
   many allocations.
 * Adding: bounding box calculation facility.
 * Adding: Exposing outline creation capability
 * Adding: a skewX & skewY transformation function.
 * Fixing: some numerical stability with the mitter join.

v0.2.1 April 2014
-----------------

 * Fixing: transparency in gradients.
 * Fixing: alpha composition on top of translucent
   background.

v0.2 April 2014
---------------

 * Adding: an ellipse helper.
 * Adding: a polyline helper.
 * Adding: a polygon helper.
 * Adding: monoid instance for Drawing.
 * Fixing: some stroking bug with cubic bezier curve.
 * Fixing: some documentation snippets.
 * Adding: a rounded rectangle helper.
 * Added: a even-odd filling rule.
 * Added: an offset for dashed stroking.
 * Added: a transformation module.
 * Change: Changed the Transformable typeclass, splitted
   it in two.
 * Added: a dumping function for the constructed
   drawing.
 * Adding: an image texture with bilinear filtering.
 * Adding: an image helper.
 * Enhancement: Some modest performance gain.

v0.1 February 2014
------------------

 * Initial version.
